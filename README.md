# Prototyping With Heroku
## A NorDevCon 2014 talk by Pete Roome (@zoltarSpeaks)

These are the slides that accompanied the talk I gave at NorDevCon on 28/02/14. The slides won't mean much without the context of my talk but some notes are included in the commends of the html. 

If and when a video of the talk is published, I will accompany this repository with the necessary URL.
