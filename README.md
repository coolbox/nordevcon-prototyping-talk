Prototyping
What do we want to achieve with our prototype?
Quick delivery
Time is our enemy here - Speed of deployment, should be at the forefront of what we're doing.
Heroku, what do we get? Price, limitations etc

Measuring
Perfectionism
Results
Addons on Heroku for prototyping

My experiences with prototyping
Wireframes
In Browser design/dev

Our prototypes
My Team Tweet - not a good product
Rakkit - Not prototyped
Giftlist - Pete's website
Taggart - Good prototype
Pingle - a mobile app
Pingle - holding page - location collection, questionnaires
405 Gigs guide

Don't reinvent the wheel - use pre-existing code, open source libraries

Measuring Data
Biggest friend
Validates what we want to achieve

What do you want to validate?
 - Pingle - location of perspective users
 - Age
 - Relationship status
 - Akin - button clicks
 - Social connection types

Herokus toolbelt
console access
database backups
logging

Heroku's limits/boundaries of use…
Fire the addons - build bespoke solutions, turn off third party support one by one.

Tips & Tricks
New Relic - Availability monitoring
Don't always use addons. Have a look at the providers own payment plans - often cheaper.

Conclusion
Heroku is perfect for prototyping
Quick, simple, accessible, supports many languages
